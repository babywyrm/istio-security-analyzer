# Istio Security Analyzer

This is a tool to analyze Istio security. Roughly the tool covers two aspects

1. Ensure configuration adhering to [Istio Security Best Practice](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security).
1. Checks the running Istio version to see if has any known CVE issues.

The tool can run in two modes: CLI or in-cluster mode. We will explain how to
run for each mode.

## As a Command Line Tool

## As a In-Cluster Workload
